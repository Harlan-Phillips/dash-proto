GM Curated View – Time-Range Performance & “What Happened” Narrative

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → General Manager
Sections: Performance Summary, What Happened
Type: Feature / Time Scoping & Narrative Alignment

Problem

The GM Curated View currently focuses on Today’s Performance and “What happened today”, which works for daily operations but breaks down when GMs want to understand:

How the week is shaping up

Whether monthly trends are forming

How year-to-date performance looks

Today, metrics may update, but the narrative framing does not, causing confusion and misinterpretation.

Goal

Upgrade the GM Curated View so that:

Performance metrics can be viewed by Today / Week / Month / Year

The insight section is renamed from “What happened today” → “What happened”

Both numbers and narrative accurately reflect the selected time range

Today’s data is still incorporated when relevant

Core Changes
1️⃣ Time Range Selector (Required)

Add a time range selector to the Performance Summary section with options:

Today (default)

Week (week-to-date)

Month (month-to-date)

Year (year-to-date)

The selector applies to:

Sales

COGS %

Labor %

Prime Cost %

2️⃣ Section Rename (Required)

Rename:

❌ “What happened today”

✅ “What happened”

This section becomes time-range aware and updates dynamically.

Time Range Definitions (Exact)
Range	Definition
Today	Current calendar day
Week	Week-to-date (Mon → today)
Month	Month-to-date
Year	Year-to-date
Data Consistency Rule (Critical)

Changing the time range only changes the aggregation window — never the metric definitions.

The same underlying data powers all views.

“What Happened” Narrative Logic
Today (Default)

Behaves exactly like the current “What happened today”

Focuses on:

Intra-day performance

Shift-level deviations

Immediate operational causes

Week / Month / Year

For longer ranges, the “What happened” section must:

Aggregate insights across the selected period

Emphasize patterns and recurring drivers, not single-day noise

Explicitly reference today’s performance when it materially impacts the period

Example Narratives

Week

“This week, lunch shifts consistently ran above labor targets, contributing to elevated prime cost. Today followed the same pattern.”

Month

“Month-to-date prime cost is above target, driven primarily by weekday labor overages. Today’s performance did not materially change the trend.”

Year

“Year-to-date margins remain healthy despite recent labor pressure. Today’s results align with the broader trend.”

Auto-Diagnosis Alignment

Auto-diagnosis rules must:

Re-run using the selected time range

Adjust messaging to reflect scope:

“This week…”

“Month-to-date…”

“Year-to-date…”

Continue to support shift-level attribution where applicable

UX Requirements

Time range selector:

Does not reload the page

Persists when switching locations

“What happened”:

Updates instantly with range changes

Uses time-aware language

Default view remains Today
