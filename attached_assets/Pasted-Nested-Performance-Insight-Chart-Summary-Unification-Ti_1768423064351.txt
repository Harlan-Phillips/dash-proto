Nested Performance Insight (Chart ↔ Summary Unification)
Title

Unify Performance Review Chart + Performance Summary via Nested Insight Model

Context

We currently surface the same underlying signals in two separate ways:

Performance Review (Shift Breakdown Chart)

Hourly sales, labor cost, labor %

High signal, high density

Strong for pattern recognition

Performance Summary (Insight Cards + “What happened this week?”)

Narrative insights

Clear deltas vs target / avg

Strong for interpretation and action

These views describe the same reality, but live separately and force users to mentally reconcile them.

Goal

Combine these two experiences into one cohesive, nested insight flow, without:

Removing charts

Removing summaries

Duplicating data

Increasing cognitive load

Core Principle

Charts are proof. Summaries are the story.
They should be nested — not competing.

Proposed Structure (Russian Doll Model)
🪆 Layer 0 — Performance Summary (Default View)
What stays visible by default

Performance Summary cards:

Sales

COGS %

Labor %

Prime Cost

“What happened this week?” insight list

This remains the decision surface.

🪆 Layer 1 — Insight Expansion (Click an Insight)
Trigger

User clicks:

A Performance Summary card
or

An issue in “What happened this week?”

Behavior

Open a focused insight panel / modal / side sheet

Contextual to the clicked item (e.g. Labor, Sales)

🪆 Layer 2 — Embedded Performance Review Chart (Nested)
Inside the expanded view, show:

The existing Shift Breakdown chart, scoped and filtered to the insight.

Example: Labor Insight Clicked

Chart auto-filters to:

Labor cost + labor %

Relevant hours (e.g. lunch shifts)

Non-relevant series dimmed or hidden

This preserves all chart data, but only shows what matters for this insight.

🪆 Layer 3 — Explanation + Annotation

Below the chart:

Short explanation tying chart → insight

Example:

Lunch shifts consistently ran above labor targets due to elevated staffing during lower-volume hours.

Annotations can be:

Highlighted hours

Labeled inflection points

Color emphasis (no new chart types required)

🪆 Layer 4 — Action + Next Steps

Still inside the expanded view:

1–3 recommended actions

Optional CTAs:

“Elaborate more”

“Generate report”

“Ask Assistant”

Interaction Summary
User Action	Result
View page	Sees summary + insights only
Click insight	Opens nested view
View chart	Sees filtered proof
Click elaborate	Goes deeper
Generate report	Opens Reports page
UX Requirements

Nested view can be:

Modal

Side panel

Expandable inline section

Must:

Be dismissible

Preserve page state

Never navigate away unless user chooses

Data & Logic Notes

No new data sources

Reuse:

Shift Breakdown chart

Performance Summary metrics

Nesting is driven by:

insight_type → chart filter config

Example Mapping
“Lunch shifts ran above labor targets”

→ Nested view shows:

Shift Breakdown chart

Lunch hours emphasized

Labor % highlighted

Sales context retained

“Weekly sales tracking below target”

→ Nested view shows:

Shift Breakdown chart

Sales series emphasized

Low-performing dayparts highlighted

Non-Goals

❌ No new chart types

❌ No duplicated charts on main page

❌ No side-by-side overload

❌ No removing summary cards

Acceptance Criteria

 Performance Summary remains clean

 Clicking an insight reveals chart proof

 Chart is scoped to the insight

 No data or context is lost

 User can clearly see story → proof → action

Product North Star

The summary tells you what happened.
The chart proves why it happened.
The nesting makes it obvious.
