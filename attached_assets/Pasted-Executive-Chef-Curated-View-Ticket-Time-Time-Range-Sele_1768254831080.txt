Executive Chef Curated View – Ticket Time Time-Range Selector

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → Executive Chef
Section: Ticket Time Performance
Type: Feature / Time-Range Control

Problem

The Ticket Time Performance feature in the Executive Chef Curated View currently reflects a single-day snapshot, limiting the chef’s ability to understand:

Whether delays are isolated to today

If issues repeat across the week

How kitchen performance trends month-to-date or year-to-date

The GM view already supports time-range analysis, creating an inconsistency across roles.

Goal

Add a time-range selector to the Ticket Time Performance section so Executive Chefs can view the same ticket-time metrics across:

Daily

Weekly

Monthly

Yearly

This should behave identically to the GM Performance Summary selector.

Core Behavior
Time-Range Selector

Add buttons above the Ticket Time chart:

Day (default)

Week

Month

Year

Time-Range Definitions (Exact)
Range	Definition
Day	Selected calendar day
Week	Week-to-date
Month	Month-to-date
Year	Year-to-date
Data Consistency Rule (Critical)

Switching the time range changes only the aggregation window — never the ticket-time definitions or thresholds.

Ticket time zones remain:

🟢 0–7 min

🟡 7–10 min

🔴 >10 min

Chart Behavior by Time Range
Day (Existing Behavior)

X-axis: Hour-by-hour (12-hour operating window)

Notes

This ensures role consistency across Curated Views and allows Executive Chefs to answer:

“Is this a bad service — or a bad pattern?”

Without leaving Accounting / P&L.
