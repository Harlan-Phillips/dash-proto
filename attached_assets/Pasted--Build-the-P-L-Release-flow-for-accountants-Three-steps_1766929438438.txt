**Build the P&L Release flow for accountants. Three steps: Select & Sync → Review AI Package → Release.**

---

**Step 1: Select & Sync**

- Location dropdown (if multi-unit, otherwise hidden)
- Month/Year picker for period selection (e.g., "October 2024")
- "Sync P&L" primary button
- Loading state while analyzing: "Analyzing P&L..." with subtle progress indicator
- Fallback: "Upload manually" link if no accounting integration connected
- On success, auto-advance to Step 2

---

**Step 2: Review AI Package**

This is the main screen. Accountant sees a preview of what the owner will receive, fully editable.

**Header:**
- Title: "October 2024 P&L" (period selected)
- Location name as subtitle
- "Save Draft" secondary button, "Preview as Owner" secondary button, "Release" primary button (top right)

**Section A: AI Headline (editable)**
- Large text, same style owner will see
- Pre-filled by AI: "Net margin improved to 9.2%, driven by labor savings. But food costs crept up 1.4%."
- Click to edit inline, or edit icon button
- Character limit indicator if needed

**Section B: Key Insights (editable, reorderable)**
- 3-5 AI-generated bullet points
- Each insight is a card with:
  - Insight text (editable)
  - Category tag (Labor, COGS, Revenue, etc.)
  - Delete button (×)
  - Drag handle for reordering
- "Add Insight" button at bottom to add custom bullet
- Empty state if AI found nothing notable: "No significant variances detected. Add your own insights."

**Section C: Accountant's Note (optional)**
- Label: "Add a note for the owner"
- Textarea, placeholder: "Any strategic context or recommendations..."
- This appears in the final package attributed to the accountant (e.g., "Note from Henry at Chubby Group")

**Section D: Visualizations**
- Three toggleable visualization cards:
  1. **Category Breakdown** — pie or horizontal bar (Labor, COGS, Rent, Other)
  2. **Monthly Trend** — line chart (net margin or net income over last 6 months)
  3. **Variance Highlights** — table showing top 5 line items that changed most vs. prior period (amount + %)
- Each card has a toggle: "Include in release" (default on)
- Visualizations render live preview

**Section E: Full P&L Table (collapsed by default)**
- Expandable section: "View full P&L details"
- Standard P&L line items with current period, prior period, variance columns
- This is what the owner can drill into via chat on their side

---

**Step 3: Release Confirmation**

On clicking "Release":
- Modal confirmation: "Release October 2024 P&L to Little Mo BK?"
- Subtext: "The owner will receive a notification and can view this on their home page."
- Buttons: "Cancel" (secondary), "Release P&L" (primary)

On success:
- Toast notification: "P&L released. Owner will see it on their home page."
- Redirect to Released P&Ls history or back to Select & Sync for next release

---

**Sidebar or Tab: Released P&Ls History**

- List of past releases: Period, Location, Release Date, Status
- Status: "Viewed" (owner opened it) or "Not viewed"
- Click to view what was sent (read-only)

---

**Design principles:**

- Accountant is in control. AI pre-fills, accountant approves.
- Preview fidelity: what they see here is exactly what the owner sees.
- Minimal clicks to release. If AI did a good job, it's: Sync → glance → Release.
- Make the accountant look good. Final output should feel premium, hand-crafted.
