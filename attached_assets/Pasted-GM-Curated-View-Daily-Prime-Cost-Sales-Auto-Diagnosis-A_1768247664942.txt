GM Curated View – Daily Prime Cost, Sales & Auto-Diagnosis

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → General Manager
Type: Feature / Operational Intelligence

Problem

General Managers are accountable for today’s performance, but most financial tools:

Lock them into month-to-month views

Hide operational root causes

Fail to explain why a day underperformed

GMs need daily, weekday-aware insight driven by Munch’s operational data, with built-in diagnosis, not just charts.

Goal

Create a GM Curated View that:

Shows daily Sales, COGS, Labor, Prime Cost

Compares performance to true weekday averages

Drills cleanly into shift-level detail

Automatically explains what went wrong and where

Core Metrics (Daily)

Displayed as cards or compact charts.

Metrics
Sales (Daily)
COGS %
Labor %
Prime Cost % = (COGS + Labor) / Sales

Weekday Average (Required Logic)
Definition

For metric M on weekday W:

Weekday Avg (W) =
AVG( M across last 8 occurrences of weekday W )

Rules

Exclude:

Holidays

Partial operating days

POS outage days

Percent metrics are averaged after calculation

Shift-Level Alignment (Required)
Default Shifts

Lunch: 11:00–16:00

Dinner: 16:00–Close
(Shift boundaries configurable)

Shift Weekday Average
Shift Weekday Avg (W, S) =
AVG( M during shift S on weekday W across last 8 occurrences )


Same formulas apply at day and shift level.

Display Example (GM-Facing)
Today (Monday)
Prime Cost: 64.2%
Avg Monday: 60.1%
Δ: +4.1 pts 🔴


Expandable into:

Lunch:
  Prime Cost: +7.2 pts vs avg
Dinner:
  Normal

Auto-Diagnosis Engine (Key Feature)

When performance deviates materially from weekday norms, the system must automatically generate explanations.

Diagnosis Triggers

Auto-diagnosis runs when any condition is met:

Sales ↓ ≥ 7% vs weekday avg

Labor % ↑ ≥ 3 pts vs weekday avg

COGS % ↑ ≥ 2 pts vs weekday avg

Prime Cost ↑ ≥ 4 pts vs weekday avg

Diagnosis Rules (v1)
1️⃣ Overstaffing

Condition

Labor % ↑ AND Sales ↓


Message

“Labor was higher than normal for demand — likely overstaffed.”

Shift Attribution

If isolated to Lunch or Dinner, specify shift.

2️⃣ Demand Drop

Condition

Sales ↓ AND Labor % flat


Message

“Sales dropped versus a typical {weekday}. Demand issue, not staffing.”

3️⃣ Cost Control Issue (Food)

Condition

COGS % ↑ AND Sales flat or up


Message

“Food cost ran high despite normal sales — check waste, comps, or portioning.”

4️⃣ Prime Cost Spike

Condition

Prime Cost ↑ driven by both Labor and COGS


Message

“Prime cost increased due to both labor and food costs.”

5️⃣ Review-Linked Impact (Exploratory)

Condition

Review rating ↓ AND Sales ↓ same or next day


Message

“Guest sentiment declined and sales followed.”

Directional only — no causation claims.

Diagnosis Display (UI)

For any flagged day:

What happened today?
• Lunch overstaffed vs normal Monday
• Sales below weekday average


Each bullet:

Tied to metric

Tied to shift (if applicable)

Acceptance Criteria

 Daily Sales, COGS, Labor, Prime Cost visible

 Weekday averages calculated correctly

 Shift-level breakdown reconciles to daily totals

 Auto-diagnosis triggers fire correctly

 Diagnosis messages reference correct cause + shift

 View is clearly distinct from accounting P&L

Notes

This view should feel like:

“Why today went the way it did — and what I should fix tomorrow.”

Not:

“Here’s another report.”

Future Extensions (Not Required)
