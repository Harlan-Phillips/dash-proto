Curated View — Financial Health Card with Nested Profitability Breakdown
Title

Curated View: Nest Income, Marketing, OpEx, Growth, and Cash Flow Under Financial Health Card

Problem

Curated view currently:

Displays too many top-level cards at once

Lacks a clear hierarchy

Forces users to scan multiple financial dimensions simultaneously

Makes it unclear where to focus first

Even though the data is valuable, showing everything at once dilutes signal.

Goal

Create a single dominant “Financial Health” card that:

Acts as the primary focus in Curated view

Surfaces the most important financial insight

Nests supporting financial dimensions (Income, Marketing, OpEx, Growth, Cash Flow)

Expands on demand when the user wants deeper context

This preserves all data while restoring clarity.

Definition (Locked)

Curated View shows one primary card by default: Financial Health

All other financial cards:

Are hidden by default

Appear only when the user explicitly expands Profitability

Can be collapsed back into Financial Health

Core UX Behavior
Default State (On Load)

Curated view shows:

✅ Financial Health (Primary Insight Card)

❌ Income

❌ Marketing

❌ Operating Expenses

❌ Growth

❌ Cash Flow

No other financial cards are visible.

Financial Health Card (Primary)

This card:

Is visually dominant

Summarizes overall performance

Surfaces the role-based primary insight (red / exception-driven)

Example headlines:

“Profitability at risk due to elevated labor costs”

“Prime cost exceeded target by 4.2%”

“Margins improved despite flat sales”

Profitability Toggle Interaction

Within the Financial Health card, include a clear affordance:

Label: “Profitability”

Chevron / expand indicator

On Click:

Financial Health remains visible

A nested section expands below it

The following cards appear grouped together:

Income

Marketing

Operating Expenses

Growth

Cash Flow

These cards:

Are visually subordinate

Appear as a grouped segment

Are clearly contextual to Financial Health

Collapse Behavior

Clicking Profitability again:

Collapses the nested segment

Hides Income / Marketing / OpEx / Growth / Cash Flow

Returns Curated view to a single primary focus

Visual Hierarchy Rules

Financial Health = top-level, dominant

Nested cards = secondary

Nested cards must never visually compete with Financial Health

Grouping must be visually obvious (container, indentation, background)

Data Preservation Rule (Non-Negotiable)

❗ No data may be removed.

All existing data in:

Income

Marketing

Operating Expenses

Growth

Cash Flow

Must still be:

Rendered

Accurate

Accessible via expansion

This is restructuring, not reduction.

Interaction Rules

Expansion is inline, not modal

No page navigation required

State can be session-scoped (v1)

Expanding does NOT change Detailed or Reports tabs

Relationship to Primary Insight

The Primary Insight Card lives inside Financial Health

The insight explains why the nested profitability metrics matter

Nested cards provide supporting evidence

Non-Goals

❌ No changes to metric definitions

❌ No new calculations

❌ No report generation

❌ No chatbot changes

❌ No Detailed view changes

Acceptance Criteria

 Only Financial Health card visible on load

 Income, Marketing, OpEx, Growth, Cash Flow hidden by default

 Clicking “Profitability” expands nested cards

 Nested cards collapse when toggled again

 Financial Health remains dominant at all times

 No data is lost or altered

QA Checklist

Load Curated → only Financial Health visible

Click Profitability → nested cards appear

Collapse → nested cards hidden again

Switch roles → Financial Health insight updates

No visual duplication or clutter

Why This Works

Establishes a clear entry point

Reduces cognitive load

Preserves data richness

Aligns with the mental model:

“Start with health → drill into profitability if needed”
