**Build the Accountant Home Page. Two zones: Headline + Action, then Portfolio Overview.**

---

**Zone 1: AI Headline + Single Action**

- Greeting line: "Good morning, [Accountant Name]" or firm name if preferred
- AI-generated headline summarizing the most important thing across their portfolio
- Examples:
  - "3 P&Ls are ready to release, but Little Mo BK's October journals have a $17 variance."
  - "All caught up. 2 P&Ls released this week, all journals balanced."
  - "Payroll for 28-43 Jackson is due tomorrow — bonuses not yet exported."
- Single primary action button tied to the headline's priority (e.g., [Review Variance], [Release P&L], [Export Bonuses])
- If nothing urgent, button can be [View Portfolio] or hidden entirely

---

**Zone 2: Portfolio Overview**

Table showing all locations the accountant manages.

**Columns:** Location | Payroll | P&L | Journals | Bonuses

**Cell states:**

- **Good:** ✓ checkmark, muted — nothing to do
- **Action needed:** Status badge (e.g., "Oct ready", "Due tomorrow", "1 pending") — clickable, styled as subtle button
- **Warning:** ⚠️ icon + text (e.g., "2 variances", "$17 off") — clickable, amber/warning color
- **Overdue:** 🔴 or red text (e.g., "3 days late") — highest visual priority

**Row behavior:**
- Clicking a cell opens the relevant page for that location (e.g., clicking "Oct ready" under P&L opens the P&L Release flow for that location)
- Clicking the location name itself opens a filtered view of all tasks for that location (optional — can defer)

**Empty state:**
- If accountant has no locations assigned: "No locations connected. [Connect a location]"

**Sorting:**
- Default sort: locations with most urgent items at top
- Optional: allow manual sort by location name

---

**Design principles:**

- Calm, scannable, glanceable
- The table is the cockpit — accountant should understand full portfolio status in 3 seconds
- Actions are embedded, not hidden on separate pages
- Color and badges do the work — no need to read every cell
