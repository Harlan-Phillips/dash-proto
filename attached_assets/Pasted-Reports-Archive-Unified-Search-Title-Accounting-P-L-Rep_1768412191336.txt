Reports Archive + Unified Search
Title

Accounting P&L: Reports Archive with Unified Search

Context

In /accounting/pnl, the Reports tab contains both:

Active reports (current discussions)

Archived reports (closed / historical)

As report volume grows, users need:

A way to close out reports

A way to find any report quickly, regardless of status

Goal

Provide:

A Reports Archive for closed reports

A single search experience that works across Active + Archived

No deletion. No duplication.

Scope
Affected Area

/accounting/pnl

Reports tab (menu navigation + list view)

Core Features
1. Archive Reports
Behavior

Each report in the Active Reports list has an Archive / Close action

When archived:

Report moves out of Active list

Report appears in Archived Reports

2. Archived Reports View
UI

Add Archived Reports under Reports in the menu

Displays:

Report title

Date created

Source (manual / curated insight)

Role (Owner / GM / Chef)

Insight type (if applicable)

3. Restore (Unarchive)
Behavior

Archived reports have a Restore action

Restored reports:

Return to Active Reports

Preserve all original metadata

4. Unified Search (Active + Archived)
Search Behavior

Add a search input at the top of the Reports tab

Search should:

Query both Active and Archived reports

Match against:

Report title

Insight type

Role

Date (human-readable)

Results should clearly indicate:

Report status (Active or Archived)

Search UX Requirements

Search results should not be scoped by current tab

If a search result is Archived:

Clicking it opens the report directly

User remains in context (no forced restore)

Data Model

Reports should support:

{
  id,
  title,
  role,
  source, // manual | curated_insight
  insight_type?,
  created_at,
  status // active | archived
}

Non-Goals

❌ No permanent deletion

❌ No auto-archive rules

❌ No role-based archive restrictions

❌ No separate search UIs per tab

Acceptance Criteria

 Reports can be archived from Active list

 Archived Reports menu is accessible

 Archived reports can be restored

 Search returns results from both Active and Archived

 Search results clearly show report status

 Clicking search results opens the correct report

 No data loss or duplication

Product Principle

Search is memory. Archive is hygiene.

Users should never think:

“I know we made this report… where did it go?”
