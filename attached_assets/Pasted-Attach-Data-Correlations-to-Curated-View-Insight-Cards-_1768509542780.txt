Attach Data Correlations to Curated View Insight Cards
Title

Link Curated View Insight Cards to Chat-Based Data Correlation Explanations

Context

Curated View is designed to show only the biggest drivers (the “why this matters” layer), but today insight cards surface outcomes without connected explanations.

Example:

“Labor increased 17.5%”

“Sales missed target”

“Marketing spend increased”

Users naturally ask:

“Why?”
“Did X cause Y?”
“What actually drove this?”

We already have (or are adding) correlation logic in the chat assistant. This ticket connects that intelligence directly to Curated View insight cards, so users can move from signal → explanation in one click.

Goal

Allow users to click a Curated View insight card and automatically trigger a chat-based correlation analysis explaining why that insight happened, using available data.

Curated View stays clean.
Depth lives in chat.

Scope

✅ Curated View
✅ Chat assistant
❌ No new cards
❌ No UI redesign

Interaction Design
1. Insight Card Trigger

For each Curated View insight card (e.g. Labor, Sales, COGS):

Add a subtle interaction:

Click on the card

OR click on a “Why?” / “Learn more” affordance

This action:

Opens chat

Automatically sends a structured prompt to the assistant

2. Auto-Generated Chat Prompt

The system should generate a prompt based on:

Insight type

Metric direction (up/down)

Time period

Role context (Owner / GM / Chef)

Example (not user-visible):

“Explain why labor increased this month. Correlate labor with sales volume, scheduling, and overtime if available.”

Correlation Behavior (Chat Assistant)

When launched from an insight card, the assistant should:

Identify the primary metric

e.g. Labor ↑ 17.5%

Attempt 1–3 relevant correlations, such as:

Labor ↔ Sales

Labor ↔ Overtime

Labor ↔ SOH / Scheduling

Explain relationships using non-causal language

“correlates with”

“moved alongside”

“was associated with”

Explicitly state uncertainty when applicable

Output Requirements (Chat Response)

The chat response should include:

Plain-language explanation

Directional metric comparison

Optional structured summary, e.g.:

• Labor: +17.5%
• Sales: +6.2%
• Overtime hours: +28%
• Relationship confidence: Medium


No charts required in this ticket.

Curated View Constraints

Curated View must:

Remain uncluttered

Show conclusions, not analysis

All analysis lives in chat

No additional numbers added to cards

Out of Scope

❌ Predictive modeling

❌ Recommendations or actions

❌ Auto-generated reports

❌ New insight card types

Acceptance Criteria

✅ Clicking a Curated View insight opens chat
✅ Chat auto-analyzes relevant metric correlations
✅ Explanation references the exact insight clicked
✅ Uses correlation (not causation) language
✅ Curated View UI remains unchanged

Implementation Notes (for AI Agent)

Use insight metadata to seed chat prompt

Correlation logic must be deterministic + explainable

Prefer fewer strong correlations over many weak ones

If data is insufficient, say so explicitly

Why This Matters

This turns Curated View into:

“Here’s what matters” → “Here’s why it happened”

Without turning the dashboard into a wall of charts.
