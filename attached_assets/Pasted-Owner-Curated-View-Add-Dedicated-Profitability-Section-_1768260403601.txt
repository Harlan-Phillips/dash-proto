Owner Curated View – Add Dedicated “Profitability” Section

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → Owner
Section: Profitability (New, Dedicated Section)
Type: Feature / Financial Summary

Context (Current State)

The Owner Curated View already includes:

Income

Marketing

Operating Expenses

Growth

Cash Flow (Owner Only)

Compensation Overview (Owner Only)

These cards surface signals, but owners still lack a single, consolidated profitability view that shows:

Margins

Expense efficiency

Net income

Month-to-month change

Directional health

Goal

Add a dedicated “Profitability” section to the Owner Curated View that provides a CFO-style summary table, clearly answering:

“How profitable are we, and how did that change vs last month?”

This section should:

Be clearly separated from existing cards

Avoid duplicating top-level KPIs already shown elsewhere

Focus on derived profitability metrics and comparisons

Section Placement

Appears below the top summary cards

Above or just before Cash Flow / Compensation (flexible)
