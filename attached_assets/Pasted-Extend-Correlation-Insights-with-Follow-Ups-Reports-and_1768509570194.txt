Extend Correlation Insights with Follow-Ups, Reports, and Store Bonuses

Extend Correlation Insights: Data Drilldown, Report Export, and Store Bonus Integration

Context

We recently added the ability to:

Trigger data correlations from Curated View insight cards

Explain why a metric changed via the chat assistant

Users naturally want to:

Verify the explanation → “Show me the data”

Share the explanation → Export it

Act on the insight → Tie it to Store Bonuses / Rewards

This ticket extends the correlation system to support verification, communication, and incentives, while keeping Curated View clean and chat as the depth layer.

Goal

Turn correlation insights into a full loop:

Insight → Explanation → Evidence → Action

Scope

✅ Chat assistant
✅ Curated View integration
✅ Reporting
✅ Store Bonuses logic
❌ No predictive modeling
❌ No new dashboard pages

1️⃣ Follow-Up: “Show Me the Data”
User Behavior

After receiving a correlation explanation in chat, users can ask:

“Show me the data”

“What numbers is this based on?”

“Break this down”

Expected Assistant Behavior

When this follow-up is detected, the assistant should:

Reveal the underlying metrics used in the correlation

Present them in a clear, minimal structure

Example Chat Output:

Here’s the data behind this insight:

• Marketing Spend: +15.2% (MoM)
• Total Sales: +8.1% (MoM)
• Weekday Dinner Sales: +10.4%

These metrics moved in the same direction during the same period.

Data Presentation Rules

Use tables or bullet summaries (no heavy charts required)

Use the same time window as the original insight

No new analysis — just transparency

Acceptance Criteria

✅ Assistant responds correctly to “show me the data”
✅ Data matches the original correlation logic
✅ Numbers are readable and traceable

2️⃣ Export Correlation Explanation into a Report
User Behavior

From the chat explanation, managers can click:

“Export as report”

“Generate report”

Generated Report Should Include

Insight title

Time period

Plain-language explanation

Correlated metrics

Confidence level (Low / Medium / High)

Optional data table (from “show me the data”)

Format

PDF (v1)

Structured for sharing with owners / leadership

Constraints

Reports are read-only

No recommendations or actions added

Same language as chat (no rewriting)

Acceptance Criteria

✅ Report content matches chat explanation
✅ Export is one-click
✅ Formatting is clean and manager-ready

3️⃣ Tie Correlations into Store Bonuses / Rewards Logic
Context

Store Bonuses are based on performance outcomes (sales, labor, COGS, compliance, etc.).

Correlation insights can explain:

Why a bonus was earned

Why it was missed

What metric blocked success

Behavior

When a correlation touches a Store Bonus metric:

The assistant should explicitly reference the bonus

Explain how correlated metrics influenced eligibility

Example Chat Output:

“Labor exceeded the bonus threshold primarily due to a 28% increase in overtime hours, which correlated with higher weekend sales volume.”

Bonus-Aware Correlation Rules

Only reference bonuses when relevant

Never guarantee payout

Frame as explanation, not justification

UI Tie-In

If launched from a Store Bonus context:

The assistant prioritizes bonus-related correlations

Bonus status itself remains unchanged

Acceptance Criteria

✅ Correlation explanations reference bonus metrics when relevant
✅ Language remains explanatory, not promotional
✅ No automatic bonus changes occur

Out of Scope

❌ Automatic recommendations

❌ Changing bonus rules

❌ Predictive bonus outcomes

❌ New dashboards

Implementation Notes (for AI Agent)

Treat correlation explanation as a stateful object

Follow-ups (“show me the data”, export) reference the same object

Bonus logic is contextual, not global

Accuracy and traceability > persuasion

Why This Matters

This completes the loop:

Operators understand why

Managers can prove it

Teams are motivated by it

Without turning Munch into a cluttered BI tool.
