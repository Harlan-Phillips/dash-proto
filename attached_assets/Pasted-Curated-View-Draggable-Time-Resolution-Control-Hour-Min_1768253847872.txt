Curated View – Draggable Time-Resolution Control (Hour → Minute)

Area: Accounting / P&L
Views: Curated View (GM & Executive Chef)
Sections: Hourly / Shift Breakdown, Ticket Performance
Type: Feature / Interaction & Visualization

Problem

Hourly views are useful for spotting patterns, but they hide short-term spikes that matter operationally:

Sudden labor inefficiencies

Ticket backlogs during rushes

Sales surges that weren’t staffed for

GMs and Executive Chefs need the ability to zoom in without switching screens or losing context.

Goal

Make the hour-by-hour view draggable, allowing users to zoom seamlessly from hourly → minute-level resolution, while preserving:

The same metrics

The same time range

The same mental model

Core Interaction
Draggable Time Slider (Primary Control)

Horizontal drag gesture on the chart

Dragging left/right:

Narrows the visible time window

Increases time resolution

Example:

Hour view → 15-minute buckets → 5-minute → 1-minute

Resolution Rules
Zoom Level	Time Bucket
Default	60 minutes
Zoom 1	15 minutes
Zoom 2	5 minutes
Max Zoom	1 minute

Resolution increases automatically as the window narrows

No manual mode switching required

Supported Metrics
GM Views

Sales

Labor cost

Labor %

Prime cost (if applicable)

Executive Chef Views

Ticket counts

Green / Yellow / Red ticket zones

Time-Range Alignment (Critical)

Zooming does not change the selected time range

Day / Week / Month / Year remains fixed

Zoom only affects granularity, not scope

Visual Behavior

Smooth animation during drag

Clear visual cue when zoomed beyond hourly

Axis labels update dynamically (HH:mm)

Hover Behavior

At minute-level:

Exact timestamp

Metric value

Zone breakdown (for tickets)

Example:

12:37 PM
Tickets:
  Green: 3
  Yellow: 1
  Red: 2

Data & Performance Constraints

Minute-level data only loads for:

Visible window

Hard cap:

Max 120 minutes at 1-minute resolution

Graceful fallback if data unavailable:

Show nearest higher resolution

UX Safeguards

“Reset Zoom” button returns to hourly view

Zoom state resets when:

Time range changes

Location changes
