Accounting / P&L – Editable Budgets Must Explicitly State “% of Revenue” Default

Area: Accounting / P&L
Views: Detailed View & Curated View (where applicable)
Type: UX / Budget Transparency

Problem

Across Accounting / P&L, several sections allow users to edit budgets (e.g., COGS, Labor, Prime Cost), but it is not always explicit that:

The default budget is calculated as a percentage of revenue

The displayed dollar budget is derived, not manually entered

This can cause confusion, mistrust, and misinterpretation of variances.

Goal

Ensure that anywhere a budget is editable, the UI clearly notes that:

The default budget is calculated as a percentage of revenue.

This applies consistently across all budget-driven sections.

Scope (Applies To)

Any section where a budget is editable, including but not limited to:

COGS Deep Dive

Labor Deep Dive

Prime Cost Analysis

Any future budget-based analysis in Accounting / P&L

Required UI Behavior
Budget Labeling (Mandatory)

When a budget is displayed or edited, include clear context:

Default state:

“Budget: X% of revenue (Default)”

Custom state:

“Budget: X% of revenue (Custom)”

Edit Modal / Inline Edit Copy

When editing a budget percentage, include helper text:

“This budget is calculated as a percentage of revenue.
Dollar amounts update automatically based on sales.”

Calculation Rule (Explicit)

For all applicable budgets:

Budget ($) = Revenue × Budget %


This rule must be:

Consistent

Implicit in calculations

Explicit in copy

Consistency Requirement (Critical)

No editable budget may appear as a fixed dollar target without clarification

No budget edit surface may omit the “% of revenue” explanation

Language must be consistent across all sections

 Default vs custom budgets are labeled consistently

 Edit UI includes explanatory helper text

 Dollar budget values update automatically with revenue

 No ambiguity about how budgets are calculated

Notes

This ticket is about trust and clarity, not new functionality.

Budgets should feel:

“Obvious, consistent, and CFO-correct.”

Not:

“Why did this number change?”
