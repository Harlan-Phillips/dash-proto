Curated View – Swipe-to-Pan Timeline for Time-Series Charts

Area: Accounting / P&L
Views: Curated View (GM & Executive Chef)
Sections: Ticket Performance, Shift Breakdown, Hourly / Minute Charts
Type: Feature / Interaction & Timeline Navigation

Problem

When users zoom into a specific time window (hourly → minute-level), they can inspect detail — but they cannot continue exploring adjacent times without resetting.

GMs and Executive Chefs need to:

Pan left/right through time

Stay zoomed in

Explore what happened before or after the current window

This is how modern timeline tools behave (maps, trading charts, analytics tools).

Goal

Enable swipe-to-pan timeline navigation so users can:

Zoom into a time window

Swipe left or right to move through time

Continue viewing adjacent periods at the same resolution

No sliders. No resets. No loss of context.

Core Interaction Model (Required)
Swipe / Drag to Pan (Primary)

Click + drag (desktop) or swipe (trackpad / touch)

Horizontal movement pans the timeline:

Drag left → see later times

Drag right → see earlier times

Time resolution stays constant while panning

Zoom + Pan Combined Behavior

User zooms into a window (e.g. 12:00–1:00 PM at 1-min resolution)

User swipes left

Chart pans to:

1:00–2:00 PM

User continues swiping to explore timeline

Zoom sets resolution. Pan moves the window.

Time Range Boundaries

Panning is constrained to the selected time range:

Day / Week / Month / Year

Cannot pan outside the active range

On boundary hit:

Subtle resistance or stop (no wraparound)

Resolution Rules (Preserved)
State	Behavior
Zoomed in	Resolution stays fixed
Panning	No resolution change
Reset	Returns to default hourly
Visual Feedback

Cursor changes to “grab” / “grabbing” on drag

Timeline smoothly translates during pan

Axis labels update continuously

No jump cuts

Supported Metrics
GM

Labor cost ($)

Labor %

Executive Chef

Green / Yellow / Red ticket zones

Hover + Pan Behavior

Hover still shows tooltip at cursor position

Tooltip updates dynamically as timeline moves

Vertical cursor line stays anchored to cursor

Reset Behavior

Double-click anywhere on chart:

Resets zoom

Resets pan

Returns to full-range hourly view

Data Loading & Performance

Data loads incrementally as user pans

Pre-fetch buffer:

±1 window width (ahead / behind)

Hard cap:

Max 120 minutes visible at 1-minute resolution

Graceful fallback if data unavailable

Mobile / Trackpad Support

Trackpad horizontal swipe = pan

Touch drag = pan

No pinch-to-zoom in v1

Permissions

Acceptance Criteria

 User can pan left/right by dragging chart

 Time window moves without changing resolution

 Panning respects selected time range boundaries

 Tooltip and cursor line remain accurate

 Performance remains smooth during pan

 Double-click resets zoom + pan

 No separate slider or controls exist

Notes

This should feel like:

“I’m sliding the timeline itself.”

Not:

“I’m operating a dashboard control.”

This interaction is critical for:

Rush analysis

Ticket bottleneck discovery

Labor mismatch diagnosis
