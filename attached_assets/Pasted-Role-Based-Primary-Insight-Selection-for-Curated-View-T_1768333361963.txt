Role-Based Primary Insight Selection for Curated View
Title

Curated View: Surface One Role-Based Primary Insight Using Red / Exception Signals

Problem

Curated view lacks a clear focal point and does not adapt to different user roles.
Users need Curated to immediately tell them what needs attention, not just show data.

Goal

Make Curated view:

Exception-driven (red, significantly high/low)

Role-aware (Owner, GM, Chef, etc.)

Focused on one primary issue that needs immediate attention

While preserving all existing data

Definition of Primary Insight (Locked)

Primary Insight = the single most critical red / exception item that requires attention for the current user role

“Red” includes:

Over target

Under target

Significant MoM or WoW deviation

Material financial impact

Role-Based Focus (Authoritative)

Curated must select one primary insight per role.

Owner

Focus on:

Prime cost

Net margin

Sales vs target

Overall profitability

Examples:

“Prime cost is 62% (goal: 58%), driven by labor”

“Net margin declined 3.1% MoM”

General Manager (GM)

Focus on:

Labor %

Sales execution

Throughput issues

Staffing efficiency

Examples:

“Labor is 4.2% over target due to overtime”

“Ticket times increased during peak hours”

Chef / Kitchen Lead

Focus on:

Food COGS

Waste

Variance in food cost

Prep inefficiencies

Examples:

“Food cost exceeded target by 3.8%”

“High variance in dairy spend vs sales”

(Extensible for future roles)

Bar Manager → Beverage cost

Ops Manager → Ticket time + labor correlation

Primary Insight Selection Rules

Identify all red / exception signals

Filter by role relevance

Rank by materiality:

Dollar impact

% deviation from target

Select one highest-priority issue

If no red signals exist:

Show top positive win or “All metrics on target”

Data Preservation Rule (Non-Negotiable)

❗ No data may be removed from Curated view.

Instead:

Primary insight is visually dominant

All other data remains visible as:

Supporting context

Secondary grouped metrics

Visual Hierarchy Rules

Primary insight:

Largest visual weight

Clear “needs attention” indicator

Supporting metrics:

Smaller

Clearly subordinate

Red / green used sparingly and meaningfully

Context Requirement

Primary insight must include:

Metric

Direction (↑ / ↓)

Deviation from target or baseline

Brief explanation (if available)

Example:

“Food cost is 3.8% over target, primarily driven by dairy spend”

Non-Goals

❌ No multiple primary insights

❌ No removal of data

❌ No deep analysis

❌ No role switching UX changes

❌ No report generation

Acceptance Criteria

 Exactly one primary insight per role

 Insight is red / exception-based

 Insight changes when role changes

 All existing data remains visible

 User can immediately tell what needs attention

 Curated feels decisional, not exploratory

QA Checklist

Switch roles → primary insight changes

Introduce red metric → becomes primary insight

All metrics on target → show positive confirmation

No metrics disappear from Curated

Why This Matters

This turns Curated from a dashboard into a decision engine.
Different roles care about different problems — Curated should reflect that.
