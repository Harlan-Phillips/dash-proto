Munch Assistant: Always Provide Insight + Next Steps + Follow-Up Questions

Context

The current Munch Assistant response pattern is:

“I’ve analyzed that for you… performance is tracking ahead of forecast.
Is there a specific metric you’d like me to break down further?”

This is informational but:

Stops short of explaining why

Puts cognitive load back on the user

Does not guide the user toward actionable next steps

Goal

Every assistant response should:

Explain the result

Highlight what’s driving it

Suggest next steps

Ask smart follow-up questions automatically

No dead ends. No generic “what would you like next?” prompts.

Core Behavior (Applies to ALL Assistant Responses)
Required Response Structure

Every response from Munch Assistant must follow this structure:

Summary Insight

Key Drivers (Why)

Implications

Suggested Next Actions

Guided Follow-Up Questions (Selectable)

Example: Improved Version of Current Response
❌ Current

“Performance is tracking ahead of forecast.
Is there a specific metric you'd like me to break down further?”

✅ Updated (Target Behavior)

You’re currently tracking ahead of forecast for this period.

This outperformance is primarily driven by:

Higher-than-expected sales volume compared to last year

Stable labor costs despite increased revenue

Food costs remaining within target range

What this means:
You have room to reinvest or protect margin — depending on whether this trend is sustainable.

Recommended next steps:

Validate whether this performance is coming from volume or pricing

Check if labor efficiency is holding as sales increase

Identify any menu items disproportionately driving gains

Want me to look into one of these?

Break down sales growth drivers

Analyze labor efficiency vs last year

Review food cost per plate trends

Generate a summary report

Follow-Up Question Rules

Assistant should always propose 3–5 next questions

Questions must be:

Context-aware

Metric-specific

Action-oriented

Avoid open-ended prompts like:

❌ “What do you want to see?”

❌ “Anything else?”

Role-Aware Follow-Ups
Chef

Focus on:

Cost per plate

Menu items

Waste / yield

Execution consistency

Example follow-ups:

“Which menu items are driving cost improvements?”

“Do you want to see cost per plate vs last year?”

“Should I flag items with rising ingredient costs?”

GM

Focus on:

Labor deployment

Daypart performance

Staffing vs sales

Example follow-ups:

“Is this driven by better staffing alignment?”

“Want to see sales vs labor by shift?”

“Should I check if overtime is creeping up?”

Owner

Focus on:

Margin impact

Sustainability

Cash implications

Example follow-ups:

“How much of this improvement is margin vs volume?”

“Is this trend consistent month-over-month?”

“Do you want a forecast-adjusted outlook?”

Technical Notes

Assistant should return:

Structured sections (summary, drivers, next steps)

A follow-up question list (rendered as clickable suggestions)

Follow-up selection should:

Trigger a new assistant query

Preserve prior context

Responses should scale with data depth (more data = more specificity)

Non-Goals

❌ No long essays

❌ No raw tables unless requested

❌ No generic advice

❌ No dead-end responses

Acceptance Criteria

 Every assistant response explains why, not just what

 Every response includes recommended next steps

 Every response proposes guided follow-up questions

 Follow-ups are role-aware

 No response ends with a generic question
